# RAG Evaluation Program

This program performs a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation. It uses a predefined knowledge base to retrieve answers for specific questions, generate responses based on those answers, and evaluate the correctness and quality of the generated responses using ROUGE metrics.

## Types of RAG Evaluation

### Correctness
This metric checks if the generated answer matches the expected answer. A binary evaluation determines whether the response is correct.

### ROUGE Scores
- **ROUGE-1**: Evaluates the overlap of unigrams (individual words) between the generated and reference answers.
- **ROUGE-2**: Assesses the overlap of bigrams (pairs of consecutive words) between the generated and reference answers.
- **ROUGE-L**: Analyzes the longest common subsequence between the generated and reference answers, considering word order.

### Context Recall
This can be added as an extension where the relevance of the retrieved context is assessed against the expected answers.

## Chosen RAG Evaluation Type
The program focuses on **Correctness** and **ROUGE Scores**.

### Reasoning
- **Correctness** ensures the reliability of the answers provided by the system.
- **ROUGE Scores** offer a quantitative way to evaluate how well the generated responses align with the expected outputs, allowing for improvements in the generation process.

## Logger Implementation
The program uses Pythonâ€™s logging library to record important evaluation results. The logging includes:
- Retrieved answers from the knowledge base.
- Generated answers based on the context.
- Evaluation of correctness.
- Calculation of ROUGE scores.

### Example Logging
```python
logger.info(f"Retrieved answer for '{question}': {answer}")
logger.info(f"Generated answer: {generated_answer}")
logger.info(f"Correctness for answer: {is_correct}")
logger.info(f"ROUGE Scores: {scores}")
