**RAG Evaluation Program:** 

This program performs a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation. It uses a predefined knowledge base to retrieve answers for specific questions, generate responses based on those answers, and evaluate the correctness and quality of the generated responses using ROUGE metrics.


**Types of RAG Evaluation**
Correctness:

This metric checks if the generated answer matches the expected answer. A binary evaluation determines whether the response is correct.
ROUGE Scores:

ROUGE-1: Evaluates the overlap of unigrams (individual words) between the generated and reference answers.
ROUGE-2: Assesses the overlap of bigrams (pairs of consecutive words) between the generated and reference answers.
ROUGE-L: Analyzes the longest common subsequence between the generated and reference answers, considering word order.
Context Recall:

This can be added as an extension where the relevance of the retrieved context is assessed against the expected answers.
Chosen RAG Evaluation Type
The program focuses on Correctness and ROUGE Scores.

**Reasoning:**
Correctness ensures the reliability of the answers provided by the system.
ROUGE Scores offer a quantitative way to evaluate how well the generated responses align with the expected outputs, allowing for improvements in the generation process.


**Logger Implementation**
The program uses Pythonâ€™s logging library to record important evaluation results. The logging includes:

Retrieved answers from the knowledge base.
Generated answers based on the context.
Evaluation of correctness.
Calculation of ROUGE scores.
**Example Logging**
python
Copy code
logger.info(f"Retrieved answer for '{question}': {answer}")
logger.info(f"Generated answer: {generated_answer}")
logger.info(f"Correctness for answer: {is_correct}")
logger.info(f"ROUGE Scores: {scores}")

Code Structure
The main components of the program include:

RAGEvaluator Class: Contains methods to retrieve answers, generate responses, evaluate correctness, and calculate ROUGE scores.
retrieve_answer: Fetches the answer from the knowledge base based on the question.
generate_answer: Creates a response based on the retrieved answer.
evaluate_correctness: Checks if the generated answer matches the expected answer.
evaluate_rouge: Calculates and logs ROUGE scores between the generated and expected answers.
evaluate: Orchestrates the overall evaluation process for multiple questions.
Sample Knowledge Base and Questions
python
Copy code
knowledge_base = {
    "What is the capital of Andhra Pradesh?": "Amaravati is the capital of Andhra Pradesh.",
    ...
}

questions_and_answers = {
    "What is the capital of Andhra Pradesh?": "Based on the context, Amaravati is the capital of Andhra Pradesh.",
    ...
}
Conclusion
This RAG evaluation program demonstrates a structured approach to assessing the performance of a retrieval-augmented generation model. Through correctness checks and ROUGE scoring, it provides insights for improving answer generation.
